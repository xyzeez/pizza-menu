# Fast React Pizza Co.

This is a React project developed using [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) as part of '[The Ultimate React Course 2024](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-ultimate-react-course/)' by Jonas Schmedtmann.

## What I learned

In this initial project, I build a pizza menu to grasp the fundamentals of React, covering topics such as:

- What is React
- How to create a project in React
- What are components and how they work
- Component Styling
- JSX
- Props
- Conditional Rendering
